[Thanos](thanos.io) is a set of components that can be composed into a highly available metric system with unlimited storage capacity. It can be added seamlessly on top of existing Prometheus deployments.

Thanos allows users to aggregate Prometheus data natively by directly querying the Prometheus API, efficiently compact it, and most importantly, de-duplicate data.

Thanos works in cloud native environments like Kubernetes as well as traditional ones. This course uses docker containers with pre-built docker images.

In this tutorial, you will learn about :

* Thanos Store Gateway : a metric browser that serves metric blocks stored in S3 via *StoreAPI* gRPC API.
* Querying multiple Prometheus instances from single Prometheus API endpoint.
