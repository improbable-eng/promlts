## Geras (OpenTSDB integration)

[Geras](https://github.com/G-Research/geras) is an OpenTSDB integration service which 
can connect your OpenTSDB cluster to Thanos. Geras exposes the Thanos Storage 
API, thus other Thanos components can query OpenTSDB via Geras, providing a unified 
query interface over OpenTSDB and Prometheus.
