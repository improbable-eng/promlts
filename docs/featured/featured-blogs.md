# Featured Blogs

This page enlists the hand-picked blog-posts from the maintainers, about Thanos and the it's internal workings. Thanos contains lot of documentation about the working and using different components. However, there are some blogposts, which have been written keeping in mind about the user's use case and constraints, which might provide more insight about using Thanos in production, and help you in picturing Thanos as a part of a bigger building block. We chose to feature those posts here, which might provide more insights and help you understand Thanos more better.

We also have enlisted blogs which are helpful while getting started to contribute to Thanos and to the community as a whole, and might help you get unblocked and provide you a seamless experience in setting up Thanos.

<!-- ### Using Thanos in Production

### Thanos Contributor's Dev Docs

Although the [contributing docs](https://thanos.io/tip/contributing/contributing.md/) is a great place to start, there are some curated explanation about the internal workings of Thanos, that the previous contributors might have worked earlier. All the internal details about the components of Thanos that have been worked upon, has been discussed in the doc - [Thanos Dev Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hluKPDKsSdOqcCpOnzr7-4PxLnUtrCl5d4-TVGch_D4/edit) - in more detail. Feel free to add in your detailed explanation about those components, or feature of Thanos which has not been covered in the docs yet.
